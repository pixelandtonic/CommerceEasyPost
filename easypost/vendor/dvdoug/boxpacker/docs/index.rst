Welcome to BoxPacker's documentation!
=====================================

BoxPacker is an implementation of the "4D" bin packing/knapsack problem i.e. given a list of items, how many boxes do you need to
fit them all in.

Especially useful for e.g. e-commerce contexts when you need to know box size/weight to calculate shipping costs, or
even just want to know the right number of labels to print.

.. warning::

    You are reading the documentation for BoxPacker v1. Although still supported with occasional backports from newer versions,
    all users are recommended to upgrade to v2/v3 which removes the "always keep flat" limitation on items.
