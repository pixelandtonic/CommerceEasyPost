BoxPacker
=========

An implementation of the 3D bin packing/knapsack problem i.e. given a list of items, how many boxes do you need to fit
them all in.

Especially useful for e.g. e-commerce contexts when you need to know box size/weight to calculate shipping costs, or
even just want to know the right number of labels to print.

See [documentation](http://boxpacker.readthedocs.io/en/1.x-dev/) for more details.
